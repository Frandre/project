This is a simple package...

There are 8 folders in our package. For Steve paper, we can find the source code script.m in the path /exp/stanford/

There are several parts we need to pay attention:
1. This code is for Steve paper and the correspnding dataset. If you need to apply to others. You need to make changes:
   a. parameters in script.m;
   b. in splitdata.m , we take the region.txt as semantic groundtruth. If in other dataset, you need to change the rate of selecting files (THE 12 ROW IN THE SOURCE CODE)
   c. by default, we think that the label NULL is 0 in our set
   d. For dataset provides groundtruth label as images, build your own ColorMap first and then make use of colortoid.m in front of all splitdata. REMEMBER TO CHANGE PATH AND CORRESPONDING NAMES!!		

2. extern folder consists of external code we use. MAKE SURE YOU COMPLE THEM BEFORE USE
3. I will upload jointboosting code as soon as I finished
